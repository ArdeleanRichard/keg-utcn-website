            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                The Knowledge Engineering Group (KEG) addresses problems in three main research domains:: <strong>Data Engineering</strong>, <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> and <strong>Neuroscience</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In <strong>Data Engineering</strong>, the group develops techniques and prototypes for managing and extracting knowledge from structured and unstructured datasets. Key areas include time series forecasting, 
                real-time sensor data processing, IoT usage characterization, community detection and opinion mining, and medical decision support. We address challenges such as incomplete records, imbalanced 
                datasets, and optimizing models for big data. 
            <p>                
                In <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>, the group applies machine learning methods to tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and multilingual text generation, focusing on low-resource 
                settings and cross-lingual transfer. Also, the group addresses challenges related to the social impact of NLP, such as bias detection in uni- and multimodal systems, knowledge distillation, and enhancing 
                explainability in AI models. Notable applications include AI assistants for cooking and home automation, and sentiment analysis tailored to the Romanian language. 
            <p>      
                The groupâ€™s <strong>Neuroscience</strong> research involves developing machine learning techniques for spike sorting, burst detection, and EEG data analysis and mapping functional brain networks using 
                graph neural networks. In collaboration with the Transylvanian Institute of Neuroscience, the group aims to develop computational tools for analyzing neuronal and brain activity.

            <ul style="list-style-type: square;">
                <li>Data Mining application prototypes for both structured data (assisted medical diagnosis, spam detection, signature recognition) and unstructured data (topic extraction, opinion mining, community detection, semi-supervised text labelling, contradiction detection). </li>
                <li>Business Intelligence application prototypes dealing with heterogeneous data integration by ontology-driven, (semi-) automatic design of unified data structures and automatic design of the corresponding ETL processes. </li>
